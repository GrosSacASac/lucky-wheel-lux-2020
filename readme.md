 * Web Animations
 * Geolocation API
 * Intersection Observer


## Web Animation

This API let us animate DOM elements. So the game should have DOM elements such as texts, images, svgs, rectangles moving, appearing, disapearing.

We can control animation loop, speed, timing functions, as well as pausing and resuming.

I've never used this specific API before, but I am familiar with CSS animations.


## Geolocation API

We can get the physical location of the user. User approval is required so we need to wait to start the game if the beginning of the game depends on it.

We could use this API in a way that requires the user to phisically move in order to progress in the game


## Intersection Observer

At some point web developers used crazy inefficient `onscroll` event handlers to lazy load images. Intersection Observer is a general purpose solution to observe specific events on the page. We also have `<img loading="lazy">` nowadays.

For the intersection observer, to observe anything I have to make a game where the user scroll or zooms.
